# Real-time Vehicle Monitoring System (RTVMS)
A distributed and dynamic edge computing application that monitors vehicles of a fleet in real-time using machine learning and provides insights and helpful predictions of possible issues along with alerting other vehicles and service providers in the case of an emergency.

Technologies used:
- Python
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization.
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for deploying our containers.
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) for event streaming and as the messaging queue/broker.
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for building APIs.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for visualizing our data and creating an interface to interact with the application.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) as the backend for a couple of services.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as the server for them.

Development environment:
- [Jetbrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as the IDE.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for collaboration.
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) for a single-cluster local Kubernetes environment.
